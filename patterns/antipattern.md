# Antipattern -- My pick:
## [Trying to fly before you can walk](https://chrisrichardson.net/post/antipatterns/2019/04/09/antipattern-flying-before-walking.html)

- Trying to adopt microservices without practicing the basics of software development is likely to
  lead to disappointment.
- The microservice architecture requires good design skills and test automation. A badly designed 
  microservice architecture that lacks automated tests is likely to be worse than a monolith. 
- Messy code will reduce your ability to deliver software rapidly and frequently.

## Better Approach
- Clean code
- Automated testing _(TDD is a bonus)_
- Design skills _(OOP, DDD)_
