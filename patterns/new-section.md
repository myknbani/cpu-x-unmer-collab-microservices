# Patterns

### What are patterns?

In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem
in software design. 

- General - _reusable_ 
  + experience reuse, **not** code reuse
- Repeatable solution - _proven, best-practice solution_

As a corollary:

- _Architectural patterns_
- Microservice Patterns
